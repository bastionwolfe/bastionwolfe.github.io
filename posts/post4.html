    <p>Hello everyone.</p>
    <p>It has been too long!</p>
    <p>I was planning on doing work last week during my week off, but my body had other plans haha. I caught a sickness and was bed-ridden for the entire week. 
    Talk about a bummer of a way to spend your week off. The entire time, I was wanting to work on my game but knew it would be unwise to move from my bed.</p>
    <p>This week, I will be focusing on debugging the physics engine in its current state. To do this, I need to finally create a repo for the engine on my main computer.
    I have been working on it with knowledge on how cpp works and without actually having it all be in the same folder. This is relatively easy to do. I think I will also 
    be looking at laptops for a more mangable set-up when I'm not at my main pc. Currently working on a mac when away makes it hard to work at the level I want to</p>
    <p>That's what my plan is for this week. Hopefully I will get to update you all next week with some exciting physics news!</p>
