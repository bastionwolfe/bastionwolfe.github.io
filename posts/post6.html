    <p>Hello everyone.</p>
    <p>I have been sidetracked again!</p>
    <p>Last week, I showed the results of my io code that was made to specficially get rid of the overhead and unneeded things that the std library contains. I also got a new laptop I have been using frequently for school and programming.
    It was on sale so I got a good price on it but it has a dedicated grphics card and enough ram for 64 gigs. The dedicated GPU will be needed when I start working with some higher-level items in this project. Overall, it was a blot to my wallet but a much needed one.</p>
    <p>Instead of progressing my physics engine and following the outline I set for myself(Bad!) I was inspired to try and create more custom light-weight versions of the standard C++ libs.
    I have created three different tools that I will be using in this project. One to replace cmath, one for random, and one for chrono. I am happy to say that Chrono and random was faster and has less overhead compared to the standard libs.
    cmath though, is a different story. My library is slower per million inquiries. They are slower by a tenths of miliseconds but I still have opted to use this over cmath. My thoughts and wants is to make everything specifically for this project.
    If this requires me to take a hit in perfomance when comparing to the standard libraries, I will do so until it creates a bottleneck in the program. This is partially my stubborness and passion for game development. I truly believe it's better to design our own systems when creating.
    There is nothing wrong when useing pre-made engines but, you can easily tell what game is made in which engine and they all tend to have the same limitations because of it.</p>
    <p>Anyways, back on topic, I figured that these libraries can be used to replace the usage of the standard libraries in my physics engine. That is my excuse for taking a break from the physics engine.</p>
    <p>Recently, I started university again with hopes to get a CS degree and be able to immerse myself in this craft. I am about halfway through my associates(with promise to get a bachelors tow years after I get my associates) and most of the classese left are the programming classes.
    I am looking forward to putting my python skills to the test(started programming in python) then working in C++ the following semester. Hopefully the things i learned line up with the class.</p>
  <p>Anyways enough about me,
  
  My goals for the next two weeks is to see where this rabbit hole takes me of creating functions to replace standard lib functions. I also have an experimental data storage in the works for the map. Expiremental as I haven't seen it implemented yet but theory dictates insane RAM increases at the negligable cost of CPU cycles.
  More will be expanded upon later once tested and implemented(These are added to a private git. I Think I set it so activity on my private gits can be seen to the public).
  Thank you for reading, I hope you have a great few weeks and see you next time!</p>
