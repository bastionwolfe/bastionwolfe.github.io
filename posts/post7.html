    <p>Hello everyone.</p>
    <p>I have time and a good chunk of updates already that I thought I should write a blog this week to go over it.</p>
    <p>The main thing i worked on is chunks and terrain generation. Currently, I have a system I am working on which seems to be very viable and workable.
    This system stores map data into two ternary inspired bit storage systems. One for height and one for Biome. The main issue you run into is it can only hold a max of 7 values.
    The 7 values isn't enough to use exact values you might see when using uint8_t(which is the fallback). So there is a challenge to making this system work. Ultimately if it does, I will still see a bit of an increase in ram usage and cpu cycles compared to normal byte-styled storage.
    I think I can feasibly get away with it by using two of my storage systems which is 60-70 percent more effecient. The math doesn't add up if you look at only this. I will be using this to put more of a focus on the gameworld.
    It isn't going to be the biggest map in history and thats fine. Bigger isn't always better. I am initially planning on having the world generate a 16k x 16k tile map.
    That would be a 256,000,000 tile map which is mediocre in terms of scale but, I'm dividing the tiles. Each tile will be divided into 4 subtiles giving more detail to the world we play in.
    After all, what point is an immersive open-world game if the world itself looks bad? so the 16k x 16k world map is really a 32k x 32k map. which is somewhere around 1 billion subtiles.
    I think the math shows it being around 400 mbs of ram space for the full map but I will be dividing it into six bigger regions. These bigger regions will be loaded to the RAM when in one or near the border of one. 
    The rest of the regions will be zipped away for storage on the disk. All pregenerated and made. Only to be updated when marked dirty due to a change to the chunk. When stored and zipped away, the terrain will only take about 10-30 mbs of space. Very effecient due to the simplistic ternary style i am trying.</p>
    <p>Finally, 
    If this map size seems to work well whe nthe renderer and everything else is added, I'll have a slider for map generation for size when starting a new game. It will have the lowest size that can work with what I want to really the biggest size that won't make it feel empty.
    The campaign map/s will be there always but will be the lowest size for those that can't run games well. I was once a potato PC owner too and can't turn my back on someone who is like me when I was a kid and excited to play games.
    </p>
    <p>I have next week off, I have an issue with not working on my project in periods like this. I will make a valiant effort to turn this around. After all, this game will only be made as fast as I make it.
    Have a good week everyone.</p>
