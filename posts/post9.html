    <p>Hello everyone.</p>
    <p>This dev log/idea spouting part of my routine is something i have come to be quite fond of as of late. I never was one for writing but when push comes to shove.
    This week is my finals week of school. I have each final about 80% done. I am also in a great position grade-wise, it just saps the energy out of you.
    I have been combatting this with cats and katas.</p>
    <p>First, I started to do katas for C++ on codewars. I added my ranking in my about me page as something fun to talk about. There are a lot of things I am learning and,
    the most important part is that I can see how others program. Next semester, I will be taking my first programming class but, I like to see what others do.
    Before you ask, I do know how to write code but, I have been longing to tie myself into the metaphorical tree to experience the metaphorical programming storm at the top branches.
    To be able to imrpove oneself and their craft is the right way. To be able to see the problem and work on it without thinking is the dream. This isn't achieved without working on it and consistantly.
    So a side-goal I have is to finish 1,000 katas by the end of 2026. Join me if you would like, stretch your brain muscles.</p>
    <p>Now then, back to the game.
    I am in the process of combining the old and the new. I have two sort of project files. One is for the engine, the other is the game. I am in the process of grabbing the useful code written in game project
    and adding it the engine project(and vice versa). I have made a lot of progress on the back-end since I last modified the front-end of this game.
    Considering the finals, I feel this is a good task to tackle while making sure I don't burn out.</p>
    <p>This one will be short and sweet. Thank you for reading and I hope to see you next time!</p>
